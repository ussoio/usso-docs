## Multi-Tenancy

### What is a tenant?

A tenant is an **organization or company** using your application. Each tenant has:
- Its own users
- Separate data
- Independent configuration
- Custom branding

### How many tenants can USSO handle?

There's no hard limit. USSO can handle hundreds or thousands of tenants on a single instance.

### Can users belong to multiple tenants?

Not by default. Each user belongs to one tenant. However, you can implement cross-tenant access in your application logic.

### How is tenant data isolated?

All data includes a `tenant_id` field. USSO automatically filters queries by tenant, ensuring complete isolation.

### Can tenants have custom domains?

Yes! Each tenant can have multiple domains:

```python
{
  "tenant_id": "org_company_a",
  "domains": ["company-a.com", "app.company-a.com"]
}
```

## Security

### How does USSO store passwords?

Passwords are hashed using **Argon2id**, the winner of the Password Hashing Competition. Argon2id is:
- Memory-hard (resistant to GPU attacks)
- Slow by design (resistant to brute force)
- Industry best practice

### Are tokens secure?

Yes! USSO uses:
- **EdDSA (Ed25519)** by default (modern, fast, secure)
- **Short-lived access tokens** (1 hour default)
- **Revocable refresh tokens**
- **Signature verification** via JWKS

### Can I use USSO in production?

USSO is being used in production, but is still in v0.x (pre-1.0). We recommend:
- Thorough testing
- Monitoring and logging
- Regular backups
- Staying updated with releases

### How do I report security vulnerabilities?

Email security@usso.io with details. Please **do not** open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

### Does USSO support HTTPS?

USSO runs on HTTP by default. For production, use a reverse proxy (Traefik, Nginx, etc.) for HTTPS termination.

## Troubleshooting

### Why can't I login?

Common issues:
1. **Wrong password**: Reset via email
2. **Account not activated**: Check activation email
3. **Account disabled**: Contact admin
4. **Rate limited**: Wait a few minutes

### Why is token verification failing?

Common issues:
1. **Wrong JWKS URL**: Check configuration
2. **Token expired**: Refresh token
3. **Wrong audience**: Token for different app
4. **Clock skew**: Sync server clocks

### Why am I getting 403 Forbidden?

**403** means you're authenticated but not authorized. Check:
1. Do you have the required scope?
2. Are you in the correct workspace?
3. Is your role active?

### How do I reset the admin password?

Set `SYSTEM_PASSWORD` in `.env` file and restart USSO.

### Where are logs stored?

Logs are in:
- **Console output**: Docker logs
- **File**: `app/logs/app.log`

View logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f app
```

## Migration

### Can I migrate from Auth0/Firebase?

Yes! We're building migration tools (planned Q1 2026). Current workaround:
1. Export users from Auth0/Firebase
